# Sending notifications using Microsoft Graph APIs

You can integrate your apps with Microsoft Graph notifications in a few simple steps - onboard your app via Windows Dev Center, use the Create notification method to publish notifications, and use the Project Rome SDK to receive and manage notifications on your app clients.

To learn more about how to publish user notifications via Microsoft Graph, see the [notifications API reference](/graph/api/resources/notifications-api-overview).
