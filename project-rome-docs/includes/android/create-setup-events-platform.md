### Create the platform

To get started simply instantiate the platform.

`ConnectedDevicesPlatform sPlatform = new ConnectedDevicesPlatform(context);`

## Subscribe to ConnectedDevicesAccountManager events to handle the user account 

The platform requires an authenticated user to access the platform.  You'll need to subscribe to **ConnectedDevicesAccountManager** events to ensure a valid account is being used. 

```Java
 ConnectedDevicesPlatform sPlatform.getAccountManager().accessTokenRequested().subscribe((accountManager, args) -> {

    // Get access token
                 
}
```

```Java
 ConnectedDevicesPlatform sPlatform.getAccountManager().accessTokenInvalidated().subscribe((accountManager, args) -> {

    // Refresh and renew existing access token
    
}
```


### Subscribe to ConnectedDevicesNotificationRegistrationManager events

Similarly, the platform uses notifications to deliver commands between devices.  Therefore, you must subscribe to the **ConnectedDevicesNotificationRegistrationManager** events to ensure the cloud registration states are valid for the account being used.  Verify the the state using **ConnectedDevicesNotificationRegistrationState**

```Java
ConnectedDevicesPlatform sPlatform.getNotificationRegistrationManager().notificationRegistrationStateChanged().subscribe((notificationRegistrationManager, args) -> {
    
    // Check state using ConnectedDevicesNotificationRegistrationState enum

}
```
